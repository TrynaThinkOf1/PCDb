## --if this is 90%+ CSS, it's b/c there are lots of lines of data stored in the CSS files--

# Overview

For a long time, people have exclusively used MySQL to build digital databases. While this is a good system to build a database, it is robust and trusted, I have come up with a ridiculous alternative; Python and CSS.

Python, as a server-side data-handling language, and CSS as a web-side presentational language, do not go hand in hand. However, I believe that Python will serve as the optimal language for this, as opposed to JavaScript.

# Goals

1. **Create a Python program…** that can parse a CSS document and retrieve binary data to convert into human readable data.

2. **Create a CSS sheet…** that can hold strings and numbers in the form of Hexadecimals.

# Methods

Here is my plan to create a CSS database for text only:

1. Create a CSS sheet that has a list of colors in the form of hexadecimals.  
2. Use a Python program parse the CSS sheet.  
3. Add all of the hexadecimals into a singular string  
4. Convert that string to binary  
5. Convert the binary to human readable data

# Inspiration

My inspiration is an Instagram reel I saw a few weeks ago. It was a person making fun of the way managers of DevOps teams don’t understand anything about development, and therefore say things like “Just make a CSS database”. If you would like to see the reel yourself, it is by Anthony Sistilli, here is the link: [Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9hwaIeASId/?igsh=MTQ5anNkcm12M3dpdA==)
